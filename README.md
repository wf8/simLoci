The program `simLoci` can be used to simulate sequence data on an input topology with gene flow. It uses a coalescent simulator from the Python package `Egglib` and also requires `Numpy`. 

Data can be output in a number of formats: 
    + LOCI format (used by _pyRAD_)  
    + PHY format (used by _raxml_)  
    + NEX format (used by _BEAST_)  
    + STR format (used by _STRUCTURE_)  
    + MIG format (used by _migrate-N_)
